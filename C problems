1) Program to find the saddle point coordinates in a given matrix | Faceprep

Program to find the saddle point coordinates in a given matrix is discussed here.  A saddle point is an element of the matrix, which is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column.

For example, consider the matrix given below

                1    2     3 

Mat[3][3] =     4     5     6

                7     8     9

Here, 7 is the saddle point because it is the minimum element in its row and maximum element in its column
