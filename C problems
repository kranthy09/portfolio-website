1) Program to find the saddle point coordinates in a given matrix | Faceprep

Program to find the saddle point coordinates in a given matrix is discussed here.  A saddle point is an element of the matrix, which is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column.

For example, consider the matrix given below

                1    2     3 

Mat[3][3] =     4     5     6

                7     8     9

Here, 7 is the saddle point because it is the minimum element in its row and maximum element in its column

An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively. Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

For example, if the input array is [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], then the output should be [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]

Given a positive integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

Example:

Input: 3 Output: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 8, 9, 4 ], [ 7, 6, 5 ] ]

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:

Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
